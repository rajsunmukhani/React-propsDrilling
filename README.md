1. Now here we can see that we as a programmer are facing lots of difficulties in making changes in code due to its non readability, for that react says that to make the code more readable ans reliable break the code into several chunks or parts as per there specification so that they can even be used more than once also, and can be readable also.

for that basically the concept used is called inheritance, under this there are parts of codes responsible for a particular task, for eg, there will be a chink of code responsible for create, one for read, one for update and one for delete, now we will use them when needed either for multiple times or even for a single time, but this will increase the readability as for the error in update part we have to simply go to the chunk of update code.

Now, these all parts are made connected to the main App.jsx file and used in it.

Now, we will be studying react in three phases, 
    1. Props
    2. Context
    3. Redux
